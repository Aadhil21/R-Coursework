# Customer Service Centre Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the operations of a 24-hour customer service center to determine the optimal number of Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) needed to minimize customer waiting times. The simulation is implemented using R, providing insights into staffing requirements and operational efficiency.

## Features
- **24-Hour Simulation:** Models customer service center operations over a full day.
- **CSR Staffing Analysis:** Evaluates the impact of different staffing levels on customer waiting times.
- **Optimization:** Identifies the optimal number of CSRs required for minimizing waiting times.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** R
- **Simulation Tools:** R packages for simulation and statistical analysis

## Assumptions
- Customer arrival rates and service times follow specified distributions.
- The simulation operates under a continuous 24-hour period.
- Staff requirements are calculated based on average waiting times and service levels.
